As far as DSC20 goes, it's not much of a data science course. It's just a Python course, honestly.

One of the best profs I've had he's nice and makes class interesting/understandable. The course itself is very easy and homework/labs were fun. I wish exams weren't on paper though because it tends to mess me up and I do badly on exams.

DSC 20 moves pretty fast in general, so it might be hard if your only prior coding experience is DSC 10, but the homework is really helpful (do not blow it off!)

Extremely caring and does whatever possible to ensure students succeed. He's always willing to help, so you'll never have to struggle alone. His lectures are also very engaging and fun. Overall, the GOAT.

Suraj is amazing!!! He was well-prepared for classes and knew how to explain stuff to new learners. Lectures were clear and humorous.

DSC20 was definitely one of the most difficult courses I've taken so far at UCSD (averaged 15hrs a week). BUT, I will admit that I am SO MUCH better at programming and problem solving in Python.
